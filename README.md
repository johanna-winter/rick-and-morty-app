# 🛸 Rick & Morty Character Explorer

A responsive character explorer built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** using the public [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

This project was originally created by **Johanna Winter**, and Efstathios Tsanidis worked together on improving and extending the application.

It demonstrates API consumption, async JavaScript, DOM rendering, responsive UI layout, and component-based architecture — all built without frameworks.
